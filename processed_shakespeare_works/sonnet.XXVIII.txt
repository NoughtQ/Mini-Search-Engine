xxviii
how
can
i
then
return
in
happi
plight
that
am
debarrd
the
benefit
of
rest
when
day
oppress
is
not
eas
by
night
but
day
by
night
and
night
by
day
oppressd
and
each
though
enemi
to
either
reign
do
in
consent
shake
hand
to
tortur
me
the
one
by
toil
the
other
to
complain
how
far
i
toil
still
farther
off
from
thee
i
tell
the
day
to
pleas
them
thou
art
bright
and
dost
him
grace
when
cloud
do
blot
the
heaven
so
flatter
i
the
swartcomplexiond
night
when
sparkl
star
twire
not
thou
gildst
the
even
but
day
doth
daili
draw
my
sorrow
longer
and
night
doth
nightli
make
grief
strength
seem
stronger
