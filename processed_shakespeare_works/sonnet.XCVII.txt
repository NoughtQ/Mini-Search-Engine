xcvii
how
like
a
winter
hath
my
absenc
been
from
thee
the
pleasur
of
the
fleet
year
what
freez
have
i
felt
what
dark
day
seen
what
old
decemb
bare
everi
where
and
yet
thi
time
remov
wa
summer
time
the
teem
autumn
big
with
rich
increas
bear
the
wanton
burden
of
the
prime
like
widowd
womb
after
their
lord
deceas
yet
thi
abund
issu
seemd
to
me
but
hope
of
orphan
and
unfatherd
fruit
for
summer
and
hi
pleasur
wait
on
thee
and
thou
away
the
veri
bird
are
mute
or
if
they
sing
ti
with
so
dull
a
cheer
that
leav
look
pale
dread
the
winter
near
